# FrontNet on PULP-shield

The goal of this project is to port face-following capabilities to the PULP-shield, and run it on the Crazyflie 2.0. Images captured by the mounted Himax camera, are fed to the neural network suggested in [Dario Mantegazza's thesis](https://github.com/idsia-robotics/proximity-quadrotor-learning), which provides the drone's control variables as output. The original network was written in Keras and designed to run on a desktop. The adaptations and optimizations performed on the network were done according to the work published by [Daniele Palossi](https://github.com/pulp-platform/pulp-dronet) and with his generous help.

### Milestones
  - Porting Dario's NN from Keras to PyTorch
  - Writing PyTorch-compatible tools for performance analysis and visualizatrion
  - Retraining the network from scratch and comparing the results with the original 
  - Applying the quantization procedure developed in ETH whille maintaining the quality
  - Getting familiar with the [GAPuino](https://greenwaves-technologies.com/product/gapuino/)
  - Implementing image capture and viewing abilities for the GAPuino
  - Augmenting the original dataset with images taken with the GAPuino's Himax camera
  - Retraining the network and estimating the performance 
  - Porting the network to the crazyflie 2.0 and live testing

### Installation
This code run on Ubuntou 16.04. If it happens to run on any other OS, consider it a miracle.
The following dependencies are needed:
* ROS kinetic - http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation
* PULP-sdk - https://github.com/pulp-platform/pulp-sdk
* PULP Toolchain - https://github.com/pulp-platform/riscv
* PULP-dronet - https://github.com/pulp-platform/pulp-dronet

Following the installation instruction on the [PULP-dronet](https://github.com/pulp-platform/pulp-dronet) would be the easiest, as they cover all the PULP-related dependencies.
